# Devcontainer readme
This directory allows you to develop your adapter in a dedicated Docker container. To get started and for requirements, please read the getting started section at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_getting-started

Once you're done with that, VSCode will prompt you to reopen the adapter directory in a container.
